Origami Handbag of Holding,"Folding time and space
			
		
		Over the years, you guys have had lots of feedback about our Bag of Holding line, so we decided to open it up to a few new form factors. Try them out. Let us know what fits your lifestyle and how you use them. We'll keep the ones you like, revamp the ones we could make better, and drop the ones you don't like into the fires of Mordor. Likeyado.The original Bag of Holding would hold anything you could fit into the opening (provided you weren't too clever). In the real world, unfortunately, we can't fold space or reach into a pocket dimension, so our bags have to expand when we want them to hold more things. And that's just what this bag does. It's a hexagon shape (like a d20 - clever, eh?) when you don't need to carry a lot; it snaps closed with a metallic d20 rivet. But when you need to pack things in, you can open that snap up, and it becomes an isosceles trapezium (yes, we had to look up our quadrilaterals so we didn't accidentally call it a ""rhombus""), ready to Hold All the Things."

Likeyado.""Convertible Wallet-Purse of Holding"" is a clunky name for a very useful item. This item is a set of two billfolds, which can be used individually or together, both of which have D-rings for the included shoulder strap to turn them into a purse. They snap together, if you so desire, between them providing 15 card slots, 3 zip pouches for coins (or whatever), 3 bill areas, a large pocket (for smaller phones or notepads) and a smaller one for chapstick or a thumb drive (a few Moo cards slide right in perfectly). Choose to carry one or both - whatever the situation calls for. And carry them as a clutch or a shoulder bag. We're all about the versatility here."

Captain Marvel Crossbody Purse,"Kree durability with Avengers style
			
		
		Purses aren't just accessories; they're a lifeline. On any given day they need to hold a wallet, phone, keys, umbrellas, lipgloss, a book or two, pepper spray, even the occasional sandwich. And they need to do so without being bulky and without falling apart under the strain - while still coordinating with your closet. So really, more purses need to take their inspiration from Carol Danvers. As Captain Marvel, she can fly to space and back without damage. She can shoulder an aircraft carrier at a moment's notice. And she always looks fantastic while she does it. This practical, durable faux leather purse shares all the best qualities of Captain Marvel (except her fauxhawk, sadly). Her iconic red, blue and gold costume is recreated with applique details, including the classic starburst on the front and mini starburst custom rivets on the handles. And if the superhero motif isn't enough to scare away pickpockets, the removable crossbody strap is sure to help. Roomy enough for all the essentials and then some, this purse has an interior zipper pocket and a top zip closure. And in case all those primary colors had you worried, there is one thing that's understated on this bag: the custom black-on-black Marvel logo lining on the interior.

Let us know what fits your lifestyle and how you use them. We'll keep the ones you like, revamp the ones we could make better, and drop the ones you don't like into the fires of Mordor. Likeyado.One can never have too many bags, we say. And totes are particularly useful, whether you're headed out to the grocery store, gaming night, or just want someplace to stash your purse and umbrella. We like this one for a few reasons. One, it shows off our RPG fandom with the d20 accent print across the top. And two, it's really tall, which allows us to stash more stuff away. After all, if you brought a tote along with you to protect your comic books, it isn't protecting them if they're sticking out the top, right? And, of course, three, it can turn into a backpack at a moment's notice. Well, not so fast that it's a free action (since those don't exist any more). Let's go with Use Object as your action during the turn to transform the tote to a backpack or vice versa, so still pretty dang fast. Just don't do it in combat."
GotG Groot Crossbody Bag,"The answer is ""I am Groot.""
			
		
		Groot possesses a very limited vocabulary to our ears, but Rocket Raccoon understands him as plain as day.

Museum of Gudetama Mini Leather Backpack,"Your Own Egg-spressionist Exhibit
 Gudetama, everyone's favorite lazy egg, is featured in their own art exhibit on this ThinkGeek-exclusive Museum of Gudetama Mini Leather Backpack. Posing in replicas of famous paintings - such as The Scream, The Mona Lisa, The Milkmaid, The Birth of Venus, and even a painting of ""Elvis"" on black velvet - they are immortalized on the striking red wall of this cracking good gallery.

Beauty and the Beast Book Clutch,"Tres Belle
			
		
		If only Belle had remembered to drop her phone into her clutch when she was taken captive by the Beast, she could have phoned a friend for help escaping from the enchanted castle. Then again, with a quick rescue she would never have had time to get to know the Beast. Would that have been so bad though? Maybe she would have finally escaped that provincial town. This sweet little purse by Danielle Nicole is inspired by Beauty and The Beast and designed to look just like one of the many books that Belle is always sticking her nose into. The clutch has gold accents, a zip around closure, and a removable 15"" strap.

Doctor Who Weeping Angel Purse,"Folks can't take their eyes off a bag this stylish
			
		
		Weeping Angels are, hands down, our favorite new Who baddies. Adipose is super cute. And the Silence are terrifying. But the Weeping Angels take a power that is one of the most cool things about The Good Doctor (time travel) and use it for their own nefarious purposes. Which is a brilliant concept. Carry a Weeping Angel with you in honor of them with this stylish purse. Maybe that means when they take over, you'll be the last to go. Or, then again, we've heard them say that which holds the image of an angel becomes... oh crap. Time to nuke the warehouse again. From space.

Pok&#xe9;mon Pikachu Faux Leather Mini Backpack,"Give 'Em a Shock
			
		
		Whether you're adventuring down the road in search of new Pokémon, taking on the Pokémon League, or just enjoying some time with friends, you can always count on Pikachu. But watch out, because as a true friend, Pikachu will have no trouble at all letting you know if you step out of line, and the effect can be quite... electrifying.Pikachu is a friend that you always want to have at your back, and you always can! With this mini backpack that looks just like the loveable yellow mouse Pokémon, he'll be right there with you when you need him. And unlike a real Pokémon, he can actually hold more than one item - lots of little items, in fact! With a zippered main compartment, two open side pockets, and a zippered front pocket, there's lots of room to stash berries, a rope, potions, repels, and probably even a bicycle. Or at least, that's what the games led us to believe. Where else could that thing have gone when you weren't riding it?"

		Don't stress out about what House you get put into at Hogwarts. Kids get pretty worked up over the whole thing, but it's really not such a big deal.

So don't freak out!

Black Widow Tote Bag ,"Stealth Geek Chic
			
		
		While in her S.H.I.E.L.D. uniform, Natasha is a utility belt kind of gal. And while we're fans of a good utility belt in the right situation, a purse generally draws a lot less attention. Perfect for those times when we need to go undercover, such as taking on the identity of Natalie Rushman and getting hired as Tony Stark's assistant so that we can report on him to Nick Fury.There's plenty of room inside this Black Widow Tote Bag to hold a wallet with fake identification, a S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued weapon, a burner phone, a Latin dictionary, and anything else we need to complete our mission. But the real beauty is in the subtle styling: the distinct Black Widow colors and design based on her outfit. It's got a really nice feel to it, with embossed dots and crosshatching on the exterior fabrics. And the Black Widow insignia is a subtle signal to perceptive fellow Marvel fans, letting them know that you're a friendly agent on an undercover mission. Even if that mission is just to pick up dry cleaning for a billionaire superhero, at least you'll be prepared with everything you need in your Black Widow bag.Product SpecificationsBlack Widow Tote BagOfficially-licensed Marvel merchandise Made by LoungeflyBlack simulated leather bag with Black Widow stylingPerfect for undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. missions or everyday errandsSuper touchable exterior features embossed dot pattern and cross-hatchingMagnetic snap top closure1 large interior open pocket with 2 sections, zippered dividerBlack tone-on-tone Marvel liningDouble handles have 5 1/2"" drop Materials: Simulated leatherCare Instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth and mild detergentImportedDimensions: 12"" wide (top) 13"" wide (bottom) x 9"" tall x 7"" deepWARNING - ENTANGLEMENT HAZARD.

Hello Kitty Mini Backpack,"Why Hello, Kitty!
			
		
		When you read Hello Kitty's profile, you'll find that she lives in a world that uses an odd system of measurement. Her height is described as being ""five apples,"" which either means that this anthropomorphic animal culture really likes using non-standard measuring systems, or that maybe they've come to standardize it all and now they use the word ""apple"" like we Americans use the word ""foot."" But you know, measuring in tasty apples sounds a lot better than measuring in stinky feet, anyway!This Hello Kitty Mini Backpack is also about the height of five apples! Assuming you have apples that are just a touch over 2 inches tall, that is. Made of vegan faux leather (simply a must in this world of sentient animal friends), the backpack features Miss Kitty White's iconic face, blue overalls, and trademark red bow. On the back, you'll find padded white straps with red adjustable ribbons. There's a zip around closure on the top, and a zippered front pocket right below where her mouth would be, if this cat had a mouth. But she simply doesn't need one - her fresh look and wide eyes say it all!Product SpecificationsHello Kitty Mini BackpackOfficially-licensed Sanrio merchandiseFaux leather backpack featuring Hello KittyMade by our friends at LoungeflyAdjustable padded strapsZippered top closure2 open side pocketsFront zippered pocketFully-lined interiorTop handleMaterials: Vegan faux (PU) leatherDimensions: 5 apples high by 4 1/2 apples wide by 2 1/2 apples deep (10 1/2"" high by 9"" wide x 4 1/2"" deep)WARNING - ENTANGLEMENT HAZARD.

Marvel Valkyrie Mini Backpack,"Fit for a Scrapper
 Spoiler alert. The breakout star of Thor: Ragnarok wasn't played by Jeff Goldblum or Cate Blanchett and it wasn't even a talking pile of rocks - though they were all strong contenders. No, the true surprise hit of the movie was the hard-drinking scrapper and Asgardian ex-pat called Valkyrie (or Brunnhilde if you're nasty). She's the last surviving member of an elite force of women warriors, and a (somewhat reluctant) recruit to Thor's makeshift ""Revengers"" team-up. And now? She's a mini backpack!   Or rather, she has a mini backpack designed in her honor. We know she's not literally the backpack - we're not drunk. She is. Anyway, this Loungefly creation is a ThinkGeek exclusive inspired by Valkyrie's tough yet sensible ensemble. Gold appliqué details like a sword badge and a buckle adorn the front of the bag, while the sides feature two pockets in the same vibrant blue as her cape. The interior is fully lined with custom ""Valkyrie"" printed fabric. Adjustable straps, top zip main compartment and a front zipper pocket mean that this bag has all the utility of a normal backpack, only smaller and way cooler. Plus it's made of cruelty-free simulated leather, because Valkyrie doesn't have time for needless cruelty!

Geek girls have lots of little things inside our handbags, and now with the The Sprite Handbag by Pixelle we can have lots of little things on the outside of them, too.

Star Wars Princess Leia Rebel Tattoo Tote Bag,"Now and Forever a Rebel
The way Princess Leia covered up in the first couple films, it was entirely possible that she was sporting some ink that we just couldn't see, but then Return of the Jedi came along and we saw that it just wasn't the case. But hey, maybe she had a certain piece of art in mind, and she was saving it for after the big victory. Now we're wondering if the older General Organa doesn't have a little something hidden up those sleeves, to remember all that she's gone through.  Join the rebellion! And celebrate this classic Rebel with a black tote purse featuring applique flash tattoo-style artwork of her face in profile with roses and and the banner ""Rebel."" There's lots of room inside to carry everything that a member of the Rebel Alliance needs, with a few pockets in there to keep it all organized. Need to fly casual, under the radar?

Marvel Scarlet Witch Vegan Leather Convertible Purse,"Lady in Red
			
		
		Wanda Maximoff has a complicated history. Her dad is Magneto, but not really (long story). She married the Vision, and had kids, and then lost them, but now they're back (long story). She wiped out most of mutantkind with three little words, but now they're back (long story). Her life may be kind of a mess sometimes (some might say... chaotic?), but at least her look has always been on point. Especially that headdress... mmm, so pointy!This Scarlet Witch convertible purse also eschews the mess in favor of classic style and clever details. It's vegan, because you don't want animal cruelty messing with your magic mojo. It's red, because sometimes you can't help but stand out. It has double handles and a removeable shoulder strap, so you can make it work with any outfit (even purple tights). But what really sold us is the subtle way the bag mirrors Wanda's emblematic headdress, not only in the seams on the front but also with the little gold badge near the top. This purse looks so good, no one will expect it's based on an Avenger - and that is a powerful magic all its own!Product SpecificationsScarlet Witch Vegan Leather Convertible PurseOfficially-licensed Marvel merchandiseFrom our friends at LoungeflyHolds your necessities for a night of magicLooks great with purple tights!Top zip closureFully lined with black tone-on-tone Marvel logo designInterior zip pocket and open pocketMaterials: simulated leather (and a bit of chaos)Care Instructions: Wipe clean with damp cloth or just hex bolt the stain away!Dimensions: 16"" wide (at top)/12"" wide (at base) x 10"" tall x 6"" deepRemovable shoulder strap adjusts from 12"" to 22"" dropDouble handles have 6 1/2"" drop WARNING - ENTANGLEMENT HAZARD.

Marvel Hela Handbag,"Kneel before this purse!
			
		
		Accessories matter, even to the Goddess of Death. Hela may have all the power of Asgard flowing through her, but even she can't help but take a moment to conjure up her incredible pointy headdress whenever she needs some extra intimidation. She enlists Skurge as her Executioner, even though she definitely doesn't need help in the death department. Maybe having nearly limitless power gets dull if you can't show it off with fancy hats and underlings!Which is why we think she would have appreciated this purse in her honor. Made of black vegan leather (polyurethane), it may not be as cruel as its namesake, but it more than makes up for it with its clever design. The front and sides feature a metallic green appliqué, based on the design of Hela's bodysuit.

Betty Brant. Liz Allan. Wait. We see a pattern. The guy has a weakness for the human ladies, clearly. Except for Black Cat. Well, actually, when he got together with her, she was just a really skilled cat burglar. No radioactive toxoplasma in her past or anything. Just genetics and the need for revenge, which sometimes is enough.So we picked this bag out for you, another human female who plays an important part, one without which Spider-Man could not exist: Spider-Fan.

Star Wars: The Force Awakens Purses,"Let's go out to the lobby...
Some folks change purses every day to match their outfit. That's just more effort than we can muster. We prefer to match our purses to the occasion, which is sometimes practical and sometimes fanciful. There's a specific crossbody purse for outdoor events where our hands need to be free. There's a special purse for going someplace where the temperature is likely to fluctuate, so we need to be able to stuff some layers away. And now there's a purse for watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Styled like BB-8 or Captain Phasma, these purses from Loungefly are guaranteed to be a hit at the box office this holiday. They're SHINY, in both the Firefly sense and the literal sense, made from faux patent leather. They're rigid and moderately spacious with a wide flat base, perfect for hiding that box of Sno-Caps under your wallet and phone. They have feet on the bottom, which keeps them from sticking to the movie theater floor. And they have a double-zipper closure for ease of access to your tissues, just in case.

		Out with the old and in with the new? Not in this galaxy far, far away. Droids stay in commission for years and years, even after seeing heavy use in multiple skirmishes and even having to be rebuilt a few times. Even if a droid goes into low power mode and just sits there like a lump, how could you ever bring yourself to put it on the scrap heap after all the galaxy-saving it's done? But then again, there's this new model that's pretty useful, and cute...You don't have to decide between R2-D2 and BB-8! You can have your classic droid and your new droid together in harmony, on opposite sides of this faux leather tote bag. Feeling old school? Flip it around so that everyone can see the original plucky droid. Want something fresh? Flip it to the BB-8 side. You really can't go wrong either way, with printed, debossed, and applique details of each droid on the outside of this bag. Either one is really good at carrying secret plans and maps, so load up with lined interior with any secret information you need to carry. They'll keep it safe and help you get it where it needs to go, after a few space battles anyway.Product SpecificationsStar Wars R2-D2 & BB-8 Two-Sided Faux Leather Tote BagOfficially-licensed Star Wars merchandiseFaux leather tote purse featuring R2-D2 on one side, BB-8 on the otherMade by our friends at LoungeflyLarge open interior compartmentSmall open pocket on inside, small zipper pocket on opposite wall insideInterior lined with black fabric with R2-D2 and BB-8 hearts patternMagnetic metal clasp closureTwo straps with 9"" dropMaterials: Vegan faux (PU) leatherExterior Dimensions: 16 1/2"" wide x 13 1/2"" tall x 5"" deepInterior Dimensions: 16 1/2"" wide x 11 1/2"" tall x 5"" deep (if you want the snap to work)  ""Will my laptop fit in this bag, ThinkGeek?""

Dog House Purse,"You've got style in the bag
			
		
		When someone's ""in the doghouse,"" they're usually in trouble. Obviously, it must not have been this doghouse they were referring to, because this one is fab-u-lous!

Maybe the merchant closet? *wanders off to look*This Dog House Purse from the mad geniuses at Irregular Choice is currently a ThinkGeek exclusive. If it were a real house, the sparkle could probably be seen from space and it would definitely violate all the homeowners' association by-laws. We're not sure why they called it a ""dog house,"" because although there's an adorable corgi looking out the window as if to greet you, there's also a grey and white cat, asleep in the opposite window, presumably absorbing a sunbeam to power those 3 a.m. crazies."
Gummy Vandal Clutch,"In Beary Blue

Of course, we also look and think, ""Mmm... gummy bears... where can I get a bag of gummy bears right now?""Throw some cash or cards into this clutch and bounce on down to your local gummy vendor to pick up some of the chubby, chewy little bears. The pop art design kinda reminds us of a certain internet Flash series from the early 2000s (the one that wasn't for small children or big babies). In bright berry blue with the lightning bolt tribute to David Bowie from the art piece, it's got room inside for your everyday essentials (and maybe a few of those delectable gummy treats). A detachable wrist strap keeps it close it hand when you need a little sugary pick-me-up, with a cool crystal shaped zipper pull because Bowie has to have his glam.

		We can think of lots of handy safety features to keep someone from stealing your bag: maybe an alarm that sounds if your bag gets too far away from your person.

The zippered compartment has just enough space for the essentials you want to take into battle. The wrist strap and faux leather handle make it convenient and, let's face it, fun to carry. So fun in fact, that you can use it as a test: some guy still doesn't want to be seen holding your bag for you, when your bag is Thor's friggin' hammer?

Keep them safe and sound, sheltered under the wing of a dragon in this purse. Designed by our friends at Crowded Coop, this Game of Thrones Drogon Purse is a ThinkGeek exclusive.

Superman Silhouette Gold Cufflinks - Exclusive,"Man of Gold
			
		
		What if instead of the Man of Steel, Superman was really the Man of Gold? (Okay, okay, we know that he does turn gold in the 853rd century, but that's a ways off from now, isn't it?) At 225 pounds, as Superman famously stately his weight in an interview with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane, that would make him worth about $4.3 million (USD) today. But only if you could manage to melt him down and sell him, which might be a little tricky, given those laser eyes of his.Better idea: honor Kal-El with these gold-colored cufflinks featuring his silhouette.

Chewbacca Tie Bar,"Tie bar any wookie would love
			
		
		Chewbacca was always prepared to back up Han whether they were smuggling goods, tricking out the Millennium Falcon, or fighting the Empire.

		When the big guy comes around (or his barking dog of a right hand man) and you know you're busted, you've got a choice to make. He clearly knows what you've been up to, but just because he's caught up to you doesn't mean he can prove anything.

Star Wars Floral and Galactic Empire Kimono Wrap,"That's a wrap
			
		
		The planets in the original Star Wars trilogy aren't really known for having ecosystems amenable to the sorts of flowers we see here on Earth. Desert. Ice. Swamp. But life finds a way. In our imagination, these little ones are blossoming on a log near Yoda's hut or in a greenhouse on the Death Star. Stormtroopers gotta eat their vegetables, you know.

There's beauty in symmetry and simplicity, and there's beauty in Chaos Theory. Let math keep you stylin' and warm with this Pi By Numbers Knit Scarf. One side has the first 435 digits of Pi (not including the 3) - we mean, well, the scarf HAS the 3 on it, it's just that we didn't count it as a digit. Moving on.

But, look. Bryant sent us to tell you he wanted you to see this. This black hat and scarf set is like a subtle nod to fellow fans of a particular cult movie about the future. To anybody else, you just have a teal blue dragon on your hat and scarf, which seems fine by us.

Rather than a tiara on your head (which is cool, but will definitely make you stick out a bit), the Wonder Woman designs are hidden within the art-deco-style print on this red infinity scarf.

Space Invaders Knit Scarf,"Does not protect from stuff falling out of the sky
			
		
		Space Invaders was a monumentally important video game. For the first time, high scores were saved. For the first time, the targets shot back. For the first time, music wasn't just at the beginning and end of a game, but played (repeatedly) as you played - speeding up as the game sped up. Yup, without Space Invaders and all the hard work of creator Tomohiro Nishikado, video games as we know and love them would not exist. Honor the iconic game with this Space Invaders Knit Scarf. Perfect for retro defenders of Earth everywhere, this black woven scarf features neon aliens, bases, and ships, with the Space Invaders logo woven into the one-sided design.

This scarf is as lightweight as the last petal that falls gently from the rose. And, much like true love, it's infinite. Aww. 100% polyester, it draws its imagery from that stained glass opening sequence animation art, and contains so many colors it'll pretty much go with anything.

Star Wars Dark Side Tattoo Lightweight Scarf,"Fashion even Vader would love
			
		
		Darth Vader is not really known for showing off much skin with his fashion choices. Which is a good thing for everyone, we think we can all agree, right? Tattoos wouldn't really be a possibility or... desirable. If you were to get a peek at his skin do you think it would have any tattoos?

Get your own tattoos inspired by the world of Star Wars without a single needle with this lightweight Star Wars Dark Side Tattoo Scarf. This 100% polyester scarf is great for a windy day but not heavy enough for a visit to Hoth.

Atari 2600 Knit Scarf,"The quest for the Gold continues...
			
		
		So Winter Games may have been a Commodore 64 game from Epyx, but it was ported so many times (even to DOS!) most of us experienced it on a different system. Bobsled, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, slalom, and, of course, hot dog aerials. Thank you for not giving us Atari folks the unforgiving figure skating events. *hattip*This Atari 2600 Knit Scarf shows you're old school. Kids today get their fancy Ubisoft Steep Road to the Olympics. But back in our day we could win the gold with just a joystick and a single button. However, given our age, our lungs are also much more susceptible to pneumonia, so we're gonna bundle up in this scarf."
Exploding Kittens Rainbow Ralphing Cat Scarf,"Hrnngggg!

Roll the scarf up nicely and shove it back in when you're done wearing it, so that kitty can live to vomit on your stuff another day."
Star Wars Rebel Alliance Print Infinity Scarf,"Who you callin scarfy-lookin'?
			
		
		Star Wars has such exquisite world-building, we feel like we could live there. Life wouldn't be easy, mind you. But sometimes when the demands of the real world are weighing heavily upon us, we'd like to just wrap ourselves up in our favorite fictional universes and pretend that the real world doesn't exist.You can do exactly that with this Rebel Alliance Print Infinity Scarf. Part of the ThinkGeek Star Wars Collection by Her Universe, it's available exclusively at ThinkGeek. It features a print of blood red, midnight blue, and carbonite grey Rebel Alliance Starbirds.

Marvel Spider-Gwen Convertible Headwear,"How can you help anyone without it?
			
		
		Maybe we love Spider-Gwen's outfit because it looks like something we might wear. Black Widow? Yeah. That black stretchy jumpsuit just isn't gonna work for us on a day-to-day basis. We had the same problem with Catwoman 40 years ago. Although 40 years ago, fewer people looked at us strange when we walked out of the house head-to-toe in costume. Be ready at any moment to not only fight crime as Spider-Gwen but also protect your secret identity by pulling this Marvel Spider-Gwen Convertible Headwear up over your face. ""Over your entire face"" isn't shown as one of the ways to wear this, but come on, people. It has EYES on it. This is Spider-Gwen's mask. Mind you, you can't see a thing when you pull this over your face (well, some shadows and shapes, but not clearly), so we recommend you use this when you're fighting evil that doesn't move much.

One Heart Down Beanie and Scarf Set,"Keep warm for your health
			
		
		Staying healthy is the key to keeping yourself alive. Video game characters know this all too well. When that red heart gauge reaches zero, they die. For non-bitmap humans like yourself, this is more of a challenge. There might be a lot more factors at play in the real world, but we can still provide that gauge. Except, it's a little chilly outside, so you're already starting off one heart down. Sorry about that.Warm up by wrapping up in this One Heart Down Beanie and Scarf Set. Complete with three pixelated hearts, this hat and scarf both come preset to two red and one grey. Maybe if you put them on, you'll fill all three hearts?

AT-ACT Sun Walk Scarf,"Sand Rover
			
		
		You know when you think about it, the Star Wars storytellers gave the AT-ATs just about the two most challenging surfaces for walking: snow and sand. And the AT-STs only got two legs to work with. We do not envy the engineers for these imagined creatures whether rendered via CGI or IRL.You, however, should have no problem taking long walks along the beach wrapped in this AT-ACT Sun Walk Scarf.

		When you're a follower of the First Order but appreciate subtlety, you'll need an accessory such as the Star Wars First Order Art Deco Lightweight Scarf. This sheer scarf has an interconnected design that features the First Order insignia surrounded by art deco designs. The pattern is subtle enough that its Star Wars-relevance won't be obvious to everyone, but the right people will get it, and they will reveal themselves to you. The black and white scarf is almost 4 feet wide by 6 feet high, making it easy to double over in either direction for a thicker scarf, or it can be left open to cover a large area.

Star Wars Rey Hooded Scarf - Exclusive,"It's harsh out there for a scavenger
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens introduced fans to Rey, the mysterious Force-sensitive young scavenger eking out a life for herself on the backwater planet Jakku. Before she encountered BB-8 and got caught up in all that Resistance hullabaloo, Rey was on her own. She had to find ways to protect herself, from the harsh desert climate and from other scavengers. She had her quarterstaff, and a few well placed friends/employers who valued her skills. She also had one killer scarf, with a hood and goggles - necessary when your primary means of transport is a homemade speeder cruising through hot, dusty terrain. So obviously we wanted our own hooded, be-goggled scarf because, you know, sometimes it's windy out and stuff. When we couldn't find one, we did something about it... by ordering the ThinkGeek exclusive Rey Hooded Scarf! Inspired by our new favorite soon-to-be-Jedi (don't leave us hanging, Episode VIII!), this 100% acrylic knit double-loop infinity scarf has a built-in hood for full protection from the elements. Cream-colored to match Rey's desert attire (""modern mummy""), the scarf also features a set of goggles buttoned to the hood. Sure, you can unbutton and detach them, but why would you? No scavenger worth their salt would turn down free goggles.

Zelda: Breath of the Wild Urbosa Chiffon Scarf,"Her movements resembled a beautiful dance
			
		
		Scarves are a great way to provide inexpensive variety to your wardrobe. You can use them to dress up a casual look or add a pop of color to a formal one. And, of course, if you buy them from us, you can use them to add a little fandom to an otherwise entirely corporate ensemble. This sheer scarf was inspired by Lady Urbosa, the Gerudo Champion who pilots the Divine Beast Vah Naboris in BotW. It's bright and colorful, just like our champion, and features the symbol of Vah Naboris in opposite corners. Honestly, if it weren't for that symbol, the bright colors and abstract design of this print could put this accessory in any closet.Product SpecificationsZelda: Breath of the Wild Urbosa Chiffon ScarfOfficially-licensed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild merchandise From our friends at MusterbrandBright colors and abstract designFeatures the symbol of Vah Naboris in opposite cornersIntentionally frayed edges for a casual lookMaterials: 100% polyesterCare Instructions: Machine wash cold.

SPACE Beanie and Scarf Set,"Space is cold
			
		
		We could say this is Saturn, but that's just because it's the planet whose rings we're most familiar with. But, of course, you're a smartypants, so you knew that Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune also have rings. So the ringed planet represented on here could theoretically also be one of those or be in some other solar system entirely!Since planetary rings are made of rock and ice, it's probably wise to wear something soft and warm when hanging out nearby. Well, technically it's wise to wear a spaceship or at least a spacesuit, also, but we don't have either of those at our warehouse. So you'll have to make do with this SPACE Beanie and Scarf Set. Next best thing, we promise."

Oh no. Sorry. ""Wear."" We meant ""wear one to work."" If you could drive one to work, we'd definitely need a bigger parking lot.

Chameleon Eraser and Pencil 4pc Set,"Change Your Mind
			
		
		Most people think that chameleons change their colors in order to blend into their surroundings and hide from predators, and there is some evidence of them doing it for that reason. But more often, the color-changing trick seems to be a form of showing off, in order to obtain a mate. Competing males will sometimes even throw down with a color-changing face-off. Yup, it's a color-change-off... it's a color-change-off. Whether you're heading back to school, drafting up some secret plans, or jotting down your score as a judge in a color-change-off, you'll appreciate this 4-pack of chameleon erasers and pencils. Featuring four smiling chameleon erasers atop tree-trunk design pencils, wrapped up like little lollipops (except these are not for eating).

Sloth Eraser and Pencil 4pc Set,"Slow Down, Avoid Mistakes
			
		
		You might think it's a bad idea to stick a sloth atop a pencil, considering that sloths are herbivores that consume small twigs, and pencils are, well, just small twigs with some graphite in them. But given the speed that sloths move at, and the fact that it can take them up to month to digest a meal, the sloth on the end of this is no match for even a hand-cranked pencil sharpener. So no worries about these little sloths eating up your writing utensil! Anytime soon, anyway. Whether you're heading back to school, drafting up some secret plans, or just jotting down a quick note about sloth eating habits, you'll appreciate this 4-pack of sloth erasers and pencils. Featuring four silly sloths (with four different expressions and speech bubbles) as erasers atop tree branch pencils, wrapped up like little lollipops (except these are not for eating, not at any speed).

So shiny...Carry these three skaters with you everywhere you go with a pencil pouch featuring adorable chibi illustrations of Victor, Japanese Yuri, and Russian Yuri against a winter-themed background.

My Melody Striped Pen Pouch ,"Let us pencil you in
			
		
		The act of writing is still considered an art form in Japan. Over here in the U.S., it is increasingly less and less common, but that doesn't mean there aren't those of us who still love quality pens and pencils. Part of what comes with writing being so prevalent in Japan is that they produce all sorts of excellent accoutrements for it, such as the latest stand-up pencil pouch craze. The bag is created with a gusset in the bottom, so you don't have to lay the bag across your desk - it stands up like a pen cup, which makes it easier to select the tool you're looking for. When you're done, it flattens out so you can tuck it into your binder or purse. We'll admit that we're a bit addicted to these. At home, we have our manicure set in one, and our makeup brushes, eyeliners, mascara, lipliner, and glosses in another.

Atomic Belt and Wallet Gift Set,"The next small thing

This is a belt worthy of our favorite Wolowizard. Although we're not sure if he ever wears the old atomic model featured in the show's logo as a belt buckle. That might just be too self-referential even for The Big Bang Theory.  

Whether you're a fan of atoms or the show, this belt and wallet set are sure to make you feel positive, just like a proton. The strap of the belt is decorated with the planetary version of the atomic model, and the buckle is an oversized atomic model.

At least they didn't choose the original name for this unit: BB-H8.BB-8 may be able to protect a secret map for a little while, but we know from experience that he'll spill the beans to the first group of so-called heroes that come along.

Black Magic Spellbook Billfold - Exclusive,"That old black magic has us in its spell...
			
		
		Systems of currency require that we all agree to live within the same fiction. Not that we all agree to carry the Triganic Pu or Rupees, mind you, but that we all agree that this piece of paper (or coin or string of zeroes and ones) can be exchanged for a specific but varying amount of real-world value. Where are we going with this? Money has always existed somewhere in the liminal space inhabited by books and magic, so it's no surprise that here at ThinkGeek we've chosen to represent it as both with our Black Magic Spellbook Billfold. Stash your cash in what looks to be an old-fashioned leatherbound book with arcane symbols on the cover but is actually a billfold. It conveniently fits into most purses and also features a wrist-strap so it can function as a standalone clutch. And with 15 total card slots and 6 bill slots, you can fit plenty of your agreed upon fiction in here just fine."
Spellbook Billfold,"Celebrate the magic of reading
 Books are a uniquely portable magic. - Stephen King   Whether or not you believe in witchcraft, you have to admit that on more than one occasion, you have been enchanted in the act of reading. Books transport us to somewhere else. They give us insight into someone else's life. They offer us another world. When you have a good book with you, you are rich. And in this book, you can keep your riches, literally. The Spellbook Wristlet is a compact tome which aims to help you convey your belongings. It has a see-thru ID slot and 14 additional card slots, one for each library card with a few left over for credit cards. The other section is a zipped and divided pocket, perfect for bills, bookmarks, and the little tchotchke and talismen we all gather along our journey. We hope yours is magical."
Convertible Wallet-Purse of Holding,"Bigby's Convenient Clutch
			
		
		Over the years, you guys have had lots of feedback about our Bag of Holding line, so we decided to open it up to a few new form factors. Try them out. Let us know what fits your lifestyle and how you use them. We'll keep the ones you like, revamp the ones we could make better, and drop the ones you don't like into the fires of Mordor. Likeyado.""Convertible Wallet-Purse of Holding"" is a clunky name for a very useful item. This item is a set of two billfolds, which can be used individually or together, both of which have D-rings for the included shoulder strap to turn them into a purse. They snap together, if you so desire, between them providing 15 card slots, 3 zip pouches for coins (or whatever), 3 bill areas, a large pocket (for smaller phones or notepads) and a smaller one for chapstick or a thumb drive (a few Moo cards slide right in perfectly). Choose to carry one or both - whatever the situation calls for. And carry them as a clutch or a shoulder bag. We're all about the versatility here."
Bob's Burgers Louise Bunny Skull Zip Wallet,"We don't appreciate your lack of sarcasm

I’m having a seizure! Put a wallet in my mouth!
It passed.
– Louise, ""Crawl Space""


Good thing, too, because it'd be super gross to put this wallet in your mouth. Mostly because it's covered with pink fuzzy stuff. But don't worry. It's 100% man-made stuff. No ground up adulterous pink cows involved here. 

Celebrate the superior character from Bob's Burgers, Louise, with this wallet that has a bunny skull applique sewn onto one pink fuzzy side. The zip-around closure on this will make it extra hard for a magician to slip your card in there, but the eight slots leave plenty of room for your ID, your parents' credit cards, and your gun license. Congrats."

Star Wars Rebel Canvas Ladies' Wallet,"Rebel With Your Wallet
			
		
		During the time of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire, you had to be quite stealthy if you were a Rebel. If you were to be found out and followed by some Imperials, it could reveal the location of one of the hidden Rebel bases. But that's why the Rebellion relied on some tough cookies like Princess Leia, who wouldn't crack no matter what kind of pressure the Empire put on them.A Rebel needs a safe and secure place to carry a bit of currency and important documents, as well. That's why we love this tough Rebel canvas wallet. It'll hold up to the toughest interrogation tactics, and stay shut with a zip-around closure. On the front, there's an applique of the Rebel starbird insignia and a decorative canvas strap and buckle, and the strap continues around to the back where you'll find the Star Wars x Loungefly nameplate and a secret message. Possibly more secret than they intended.

Crit Success D20 Belt and Wallet Gift Set,"Pick a little something up at Gnome Depot
			
		
		Sure, gold pieces may have inherent value, more than a piece of paper or plastic, but they're kind of complicated to carry around. When the Sacagawea dollar coins came out, we pondered bringing some with us to the Renaissance festival, but once you cover your obligatory turkey leg and your mead and your pointy princess hat with the tulle, you've got some serious mass hanging from your belt. Possibly enough to call for a new belt. Show off your D&D fandom with this Crit Success D20 Belt and Wallet Gift Set. The canvas belt features an oversized d20 buckle worthy of Wolowitz and the bifold wallet has a small metal d20 on front."

Museum of Gudetama ID/Card Holder,"Eggistential art

We'll be the first to admit it: Gudetama is a little odd. But, you know, if we were a sentient egg whose every thought was about when we were going to be eaten, we'd probably be a little weird, too. 

Weird enough to be the main character in The Scream by Edvard Munch. Actually, when you consider Munch's original title, Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature), it's even more appropriate. An egg is a natural thing and this one happens to have realized the nature of its own existence. It's a scream of nature about nature. And... we might be overanalyzing this. It's a card holder with a cartoon egg on it. It has three slots: two for cards or whatever and one clear vinyl ID slot with thumb assist, so you don't have to make the face from The Scream while trying to wrestle with your driver's license."
Captain Marvel Vegan Leather Wallet,"Cash, credit, and Carol
			
		
		Avengers. A-Force. Ultimates. Captain Marvel has a knack for spreading herself thin across a lot of teams - and that's not counting her time as Ms. Marvel, Warbird, or Binary. We know Carol can handle herself, but it got us thinking: what do her expense reports look like? Do you think she has a corporate card for every team, or is she just really scrupulous with her receipts? Somebody has to be reimbursing her for all those working dinners, even if they do happen off-world. Maybe Carol has a wallet like this one to keep her finances organized. After all, it already matches her costume! Made of blue vegan leather, the wallet features gold appliqué stripes and starburst details on the front and a zipped coin pocket on the back. Unsnap the magnetic closure, open the trifold wallet, and behold - the interior is lined with red fabric in a custom blue starburst pattern! With 3 separate bill pockets and 7 card slots, there is plenty of space to keep any expenses organized. Though one of those card slots is a clear ID slot with a thumb-assist, which is great for a driver's license but may not be big enough to hold all her team ID cards. Hopefully she has lanyards for those. Annnd now we desperately want to see Captain Marvel trying to swipe into the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station with a lanyard, while floating in space.

NASA Scout Wallet,"Enough space for all your requirements
			
		
		You gotta imagine that by the time we're pondering taking things like wallets into space with us, humans are going to have developed past physical money. Transactions are all going to be some sort of digital cryptocurrency that we access via something like a retinal scan. Of course, there will always be holdouts, but those sorts of people probably aren't going to be the first in line to colonize another planet.But while we're stuck planetside, we've still got money in the form of plastic and paper. And we need a convenient way to carry it around since 7-Eleven doesn't have retinal scanners installed yet. This NASA Scout wallet has the NASA ""meatball"" logo on the front, and an American flag printed on the inside.

James Webb Space Telescope Wallet - Exclusive,"Everybody say ""Au""
			
		
		If you're a fan of the James Webb Space Telescope project, you're probably a fan of gold. After all, JWST uses gold on the mirror array (to optimize for infrared light) and also the baffles that direct heat generated by the onboard electronics away from the integrated science instrument module (ISIM). And while gold plays an important role in the monetary systems here on Earth, it's not something you want to carry around to exchange for a Slurpee. Or even a downpayment.Plastic and cash are much easier alternatives these days. And if you've gone the way of Bitcoin and blockchains, this can still hold your ID cards. This trifold wallet has the iconic hexagonal mirror array from the James Webb Space Telescope embossed on the front and its name on the back in case anybody was confused and thought you were a fan of bees. Of course, these things aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, we're fans of both."

Rugrats Chuckie's Shirt Bifold Wallet - Exclusive,"This Is Such a Good Idea
			
		
		Babies don't need wallets of course, but when you get all growed up like age three or four, they start trusting you with the responsibility of a little pocket money. If you're super special and amazing like Angelica, you might even get a weekly allowance to take to the toy store and spend on whatever you like. Of course, you could fritter that money away on silly baby stuff like a new ball or somethin', or you could listen to that hot tip you got on the playground and invest it in something that will be worth a gajillion dollars someday, like Cynthia doll accessories!But if you're afraid of losing your money, best to keep it somewhere super safe. Inside a wallet that Finster approved, you'll never have to worry about misplacing your money, or getting a bunch of icky germs on it, or having it messed with by clowns or the guy on the oatmeal box with the scary hat. With six card pockets, a large bill pocket, and an ID window with thumb assist, you can keep all your grown up stuff organized. Now, off to the store for some Reptar Bars!

Atari Black Katakana Wallet,"No space for quarters
			
		
		Millions of years ago, if a geek wanted to play video games, they had to take a pocketful of quarters to the mall where darkened rooms filled with 6-foot-tall cabinets bleeped and blooped in glowing 8-bit goodness. We had to use our imaginations and believe that jagged white lines were massive hurtling asteroids, and that a triangle was your intrepid starship attempting to navigate the void. That was our first introduction to Atari, and those amazing Centipede and Tempest cabinets convinced us that we needed a way to play without quarters - a way to play from the comfort of our own homes. Not only were the floors at home less sticky, but also it gave us time to commune with the games enough that we could find things like Warren Robinett's Adventure Easter egg. Get rid of the quarters and remember a time when you had to use the A/V switcher to play your Atari 2600 with this wallet."

Deadpool LED Light-Up Beanie,"Headpool, only not as annoying

Not sure if you noticed or not, but I was on something of a self-absorbed monologue there. That kind of narcissism is tough to foster outside of social media. Actually -- where's my phone? I should totally tweet about this. #SurroundedByAssassinsButStillKillingIt 
- Deadpool: Assassin Vol. 1 #5


Sometimes when the winter rolls around you don't just need a hat - you need a hat that makes a statement. Like the ones those women wear to the Kentucky Derby while they're slamming mint juleps and pretending to watch horses, you know? Except less likely to get bent outta shape when you sit on it, because you know you're going to accidentally sit on it one day. Where were we? Oh yes - statement hat. This hat makes a statement. It flippin' lights up. And if not enough people are staring at you when you turn this hat on in the middle of the ballet, you can set it to flash. You know, flashing would make ballet more interesting. Maybe they should add that."
Galaxy Beanie with LED Stars,"Head full of stars
			
		
		The mysteries of the universe seem so far away, and yet so close when we need only step outside our door to see the sparkling starstuff thousands and thousands of light years away. Or even nearer still, if we turn off the lights and look at our own hat!This hat is perfect for folks who live in cities full of light pollution who don't get to experience the majesty of the twinkling night sky. Now you'll still see twinkling lights without even having to drive out to the country or break out the telescope. This black knit beanie with a nebulous design (see what we did there?) includes 5 bright white LED stars. And if they get to be a bit too bright, there's an on/off switch so you can just be spacy, which is still pretty cool."

That works, too. Wrap up in power with this Wonder Woman hat and scarf set. Both feature 4"" pom poms and the double-W logo in gold faux leather on a color-scheme pulled from the DCEU."
Star Wars Darth Vader LED Light-Up Beanie,"Because the Dark Side can be dark
			
		
		Vader went through a few different head options before settling on the helmet and face mask we've come to know and love and fear. First, there was the painted-white William Shatner mask, but that had already been done. Then there was this beanie, with a face on it. It was hip and just a touch menacing, if pulled down all the way. Eventually, Vader decided on his iconic look, but we didn't want to let this beanie be forgotten. Each Star Wars Darth Vader LED Light-Up Beanie features a knit exterior with Vader's mug embroidered into the design (white design on black hat). But wait. When you push the button in the fold-over cuff, tiny cold white LEDs around the eyes and mouth grill light up. And when you push it a second time, they blink, as if a warning. And when you push it a third time, they go dark. This winter, protect your head with the power of the light-up Dark Side."
Super Mario Piranha Plant Beanie,"Chomp!
			
		
		Boy, we'll tell ya, these plants sure are hungry. And not for normal plant things either - they don't want sunlight and water. They're big and strong and require a little more protein in their diet. They've got their sights set on chomping a Mario brother. That is, if they had eyes. Maybe that's why they're chomping our heads instead - they can't see we aren't Mario. We'll let it slide since they keep our head warm.Keep your head nice and toasty while being slowly chomped by a piranha plant. It may have pointy teeth, but we promise it won't hurt... much.

Crit Success d20 Banded Trilby,"+1 to CHA
			
		
		If you are the sort of person who says ""Crit Success"" instead of that you ""rolled a crit"" or got a ""critical success,"" this might be your hat. See, the trilby has taken a lot of flack recently by being worn by certain types of people, and so it requires some confidence to don. But you? You're not those people. You're clever. Savvy. You don't feel like other people owe you anything except maybe the permission to wear this hat with aplomb. And hopefully this Crit Success D20 Banded Trilby will reinforce that by helping you see yourself with charisma and confidence. After all, dashing hats are the world of Indiana Jones. Carmen Sandiego. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant. Rorschach from Watchmen. Inspector Gadget. And Finn and Jake's dad in Adventure Time."

Star Wars Boba Fett Marled Cuff Beanie,"For Cold Desert Nights
			
		
		The long, cold, lonely nights out on the deserts of Tatooine can be just as frigid and hopeless as the days are hot. Particularly if you find yourself crawling across those sands - having just escaped certain death at the hands of a Sarlacc in the Pit of Carkoon - and attempting to return to civilization... with nothing but the ruins of exploded skiffs and chunks of Hutt-flesh to clamber over, miles and miles and miles of unsurvivable desert to traverse...

Narwhal Beanie,"If You Can't Be A Unicorn...
 As the saying goes, Always Be Yourself... Unless You Can Be a Unicorn. But let's face it - anytime someone in the Middle Ages brought home a ""unicorn horn"" for their king to make a throne out of or whatever, it was really a narwhal tusk. And when we say ""tusk,"" we mean tooth, because that's what a narwhal tusk (and therefore, every ""unicorn horn"") really is. Which has to be the Tooth Fairy's most-sought-after prize. Sorry, TF, for putting those boring and weird human canines under our pillows. If we could have been narwhals, we could have done better by you.  So why put on a regular old thinking cap when you could be sporting a narwhal beanie instead? Soft and fuzzy with two big black narwhal eyes and (of course) a big twisty narwhal tusk/tooth protruding out the front, you're one step closer to being the unicorn of the sea."
Superman Logo Strapback Cap,"Just part of the costume

SPACE Beanie and Scarf Set,"Space is cold
			
		
		We could say this is Saturn, but that's just because it's the planet whose rings we're most familiar with. But, of course, you're a smartypants, so you knew that Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune also have rings. So the ringed planet represented on here could theoretically also be one of those or be in some other solar system entirely!Since planetary rings are made of rock and ice, it's probably wise to wear something soft and warm when hanging out nearby. Well, technically it's wise to wear a spaceship or at least a spacesuit, also, but we don't have either of those at our warehouse. So you'll have to make do with this SPACE Beanie and Scarf Set.

		So if you're an Emblem Heartless your mileage may vary with this hat - after all, you might not have a head at all, let alone one that can accommodate a hat, depending on the world you're in. The one thing we can tell you, though, is that this black hat looks great with those gold eyes. This Kingdom Hearts Heartless Cap features the Heartless emblem in dimensional white embroidery on the front (it sort of drips down onto the brim in a really cool way). The side has the Kingdom Hearts logo, and the back features white embroidery of the Nightmare, Unversed, and Nobody emblems. Basically, you got all your bad guy bases covered."

We need that to happen in real life. Presumably this 8-bit rainbow leads to an 8-bit Asgard or has Super Mario coins at its base. But right now, it's on your head. Literally. This comfy, unstructured 6-panel black cap with black covered eyelets features a four color 8-bit rainbow embroidered on the front and has an adjustable strapback closure so even characters with those oversized 8-bit heads (we're looking at you, Mario) can wear it."
Pusheen Cap,"The Inertia Is Strong With This One
			
		
		With this cap, you basically come equipped with a warning label: ""Today, I will move as slowly as a sloth on Xanax. I will have the motivation of drunken fruit fly. I will have the strength of a bacterium in a moldy petri dish."" But since the cap has Pusheen on it, you'll still look cute, even when you're too lazy to move, her default state."
Beauty and the Beast Strapback Cap,"The true beauty is this hat
			
		
		Most of us here at the office are monkeys, so we'll be fine with accepting the role of beast. The difference is that we don't have a big library full of books (yet - we're working on it) or talking household items to help win you over. We do, however, have fantastic taste in hats. Ones that are subtle and amazing, like this one here. We won't hide it away in the forbidden west wing, either. So bonus points on that one.The Beauty and the Beast Strapback Hat comes in black and features a single red rose right in the center. On the back are the words ""I only date beasts."" A hat so good even Gaston would agree with us. And no one wears a hat like Gaston.Product SpecificationsBeauty and the Beast Strapback HatOfficially-licensed Beauty and the Beast merchandiseBlack hat with red rose front and center and ""I only date beasts"" along the backHas strapback to adjust the sizeMaterials: 100% cotton Care Instructions: Hand wash only.

Shark Attack Cap,"Chomp!
			
		
		Taking a shark out of the ocean and plopping it on your head may seem like a bold new fashion statement, but there are a few risks involved. Most notably, some very pointy and bitey risks. We've found a way to still make you a trendy fashion icon, while not having to worry about the sharp bits.Wear a shark on your head! No, not a real one, but a hat that looks like one. This grey hat features a fin on top with a particularly angry looking shark on the front. We wonder why it's mad. Maybe because we plucked it out of the ocean and used it to cover our head."

Firefly Blue Sun Dad Hat,"Seen That Logo Somewhere Before
			
		
		Blue Sun is everywhere. Just try to escape that logo - everywhere you go in the 'verse, you'll still see it. On coffee cans, foodstuffs, billboards, posters, computer systems, biotech tools - heck, you might even catch the logo in the corner of a wave transmission, since they've got their fingers into the communication industry. Their reportedly long, blue fingers... what, don't tell us you haven't heard the rumors? Next you'll be sayin' you haven't heard the one about them putting subliminal messages in the Oaty Bars ads.

Firefly Jayne's Hat,"Cunning, dontcha think?
			
		
		Anti-heroes are the best. You don't have to put up with the holier-than-thou attitude, and you get the same results in the end. Granted, the hero half of Jayne's anti-heroism is because the good guys pay better. And, for the town of Canton, because strongboxes are heavy ballast. Okay. So he's an accidental hero. This is good because it leaves him room to kick some ass when he needs to, without a second thought. Well, without much thought at all. That's what we love about Jayne. He's uncomplicated. That, and the hat. Gotta love the hat. Get yourself Jayne's iconic hat with this 100% acrylic option from QMx.

		You know how in superhero movies when a lead character is trying to lay low they always seem to have a hat on? Hard to imagine that would work for the majority of the Overwatch crew. We're not even going to touch on Winston. The point is, for most of us, this is a nice way to rep one of your favorite games in a casual fashion.

Deadpool Fuzzy Bunny Slippers,"Perfect for when you're reading the want ads or some comics
			
		
		Those Deadpool bunny slippers that were a Loot Crate exclusive? Yeah. We got 'em. Now they're apparently our exclusive. We're not sure how that works, but we think some of our merchant monkeys may be confused. But it doesn't really matter, does it, because LOOK DEADPOOL BUNNY SLIPPERS. Available here at ThinkGeek for the pure satisfaction of your tootsies. And ours have a white fluffy bunny tail on the back, because they're superior. (Maybe that's what's ""exclusive"" about them? We don't know. We do not get paid to understand. We only get paid to make with the monkey words.) But admit it. You do not need these. But you want them. Much like that last ill-advised chimichanga...."
Harry Potter House Slippers,"6 of one, half a dozen of another....
			
		
		Some people are firmly in one House at Hogwarts. Gryffindor through and through. Or Slytherin to the end. Others of us might be a little in one camp and a little in the other. It's as if the Sorting Hat went, ""Ehhh. Come back to me later"" with us.Now you can literally have a foot in both camps with these Harry Potter House Slippers. They come as a pre-matched set, but if you're a bit of one House and a bit of another, buy two sets and wear one of each (and share with a friend). They're perfect for putting your feet up in the Common Room and then trekking the occasionally circuitous staircase to your room."
NASA Astronaut Boot Plush Slippers,"You'll love these slippers to the Moon and back
			
		
		You know, we hadn't ever thought about it, but astronauts live out of their vehicles, don't they? Their vehicles just happen to be worth billions of dollars and not so much listed in the Kelly Blue Book. What's the current trade-in value on a shuttle anyhow? High mileage but kept in pristine condition.If you've got some Extravehicular Activity planned, such as hanging out on the couch, we'd highly recommend these slippers, inspired by the boots of NASA's astronauts. Much like NASA's EVA suits, these reflect the heat of the sun and are easily visible against the blackness of space. These do not, however, have a water cooling system. You'll have to get up and shuffle over to the thermostat for temperature control and to the fridge for drinks. Sorry."
Rugrats Reptar Plush Slippers,"They're plush, they're mean, they'll turn your feet green!

That's a STEP in the right direction! Eh! Eh!? We'll see ourselves out....Be mean and green... and comfy! The Rugrats Reptar Plush Slippers feature Reptar's head, tail, and scales, but we promise these are much more cozy than actual scales. No-slip dots on the bottom for grip when you're stomping a city."
Shark Plush Slippers for Grown Ups,"Gonna need a bigger closet
You know what we hate? Well, many things, but amongst them is the action of stubbing our toes. It's not like we didn't KNOW the thing was there. Somehow our brain just forgot to tell our foot. It makes us just want to kick the thing in retribution... gently. That's where these Chomping Shark Plush Slippers come in, because not only do they come with dimensional tail and fins, but the front of each features the gaping maw of a shark. You just gotta threaten whatever it is you stubbed your toe on with that toothy grin, and it'll be sorry.    These Chomping Shark Plush Slippers look just like Great White Sharks, and in order to wear them you must slip your foot deep into the sharks' bellies (accessed via the little known secret hatch behind every shark's dorsal fin). Will your feet emerge unscathed? Maybe. Will they be cozy and comfortable? Definitely!"
Plush Zombie Slippers,"Tasty Toasty feet!
     Ever wake up in the morning and feel groggy and disoriented? Every morning? Don't worry, you're not alone. We'll admit to being zombies in the morning hours, which is probably why we schedule most of our important meetings for after lunch. As such, we thought it would be awesome to slip our feet into some Plush Zombie Slippers in the morning. If we're going to feel like zombies, we might as well dress the part, right? This pair of zombies is a little confused. Where are your brains again? Let them gently nom on your feet. Who knew being chewed on was so comfortable? Best of all, there's no right foot or left foot. Makes it easy to put 'em on in the morning when you have half a brain."

		We know what you're thinking - ""ThinkGeek, anglerfish are much more creepy looking, and have sharp and pointy teeth! These don't look scary at all!"" And to that we say... yep. We know that the real deal are far more menacing looking, but, trust us, your pets will thank you for not wearing the real thing around on your feet.Let the anglerfish keep your toesies warm on brisk mornings and frigid nights. The esca (AKA -  glowy ball) cycles through green, blue, red, and yellow lights. Don't worry, it will not lure in your pets to try and eat them. Well, the unclear antecedent kind of works out there, doesn't it? The pets may try to eat the esca, so be careful with that. But your pets are safe from the slippers' appetites themselves."

Orochi Dragon USB Heated Slippers ,"Legendary Foot Warmers
			
		
		Imagine this: Two dragons, not content with breathing fire, terrorizing lands, and fighting the storm god Susanoo, instead choose to use their power for good, using their innate (USB-powered) heat to keep your feet warm instead of burning down the local izakaya. Sounds ideal, yes? Now these dragons can be yours with this set of Orochi Dragon USB Heated Slippers. Based on the Japanese legend of the Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed and eight-tailed dragon, this set's version is adorable and does not need to be slain.

Batman Caped Uniform Slippers,"Perfect for dark nights
			
		
		Lots of us have jobs that are hard on our feet. If you work in the food industry, in retail, in nursing, you spend a lot of your time on your toes. And when you spend your nights leaping from roof to roof, that can also be hard on your feet. Sure, the Batmobile can get him places when Batman wants to avoid walking, but it's not as satisfying as doling out vengeance on foot.That's why after his shower Alfred brings Bruce Wayne these Batman Caped Uniform Slippers. They're soft with padded soles and, of course, a tiny cape. They're just what the podiatrist ordered. Well, that and some time off. But it ain't like that's happening."

Guardians of the Galaxy Groot Slippers,"I am slipper

Labyrinth 'Ello Worm Plush Slippers,"A friendly face for tired feet
			
		
		Of all the fantastical creatures Sarah encounters in Jim Henson's classic film Labyrinth, that adorable little worm is hands-down the friendliest. He greets her with a hearty ""'Ello."" He invites her in to meet the missus and have a nice cup of tea (though how she'd fit in a worm home, we'll never know). He may not know the way through the Labyrinth - he's just a worm, after all - but if she'd stuck around he could have pointed her straight to the castle. The whole movie would have turned out different if Sarah had just listened to the worm. Don't be like Sarah. Stop and appreciate the worm. Or, in this case, wear the worm - because now his friendly face is made for tired feetsies!

We'd always been struck by the fact that so much time has passed since the light left the twinkling stars we see at night that many of them may no longer be in existence by the time the light reaches us. But with the new Cosmos, Neil DeGrasse Tyson changed how we look up into the sky. Every time we look up now, we imagine we're traveling back in time. It makes the stars less bittersweet.

Stars on your feet? Totally sweet. These navy blue slide slippers feature familiar constellations and asterisms. The soles are padded. We think they're perfect for that backyard ""camping trip"" to gaze at the stars. (And run back inside when you need to pee.)"

Like aiming for the head.That's why we hands-down pick Loki every time. See, if you're Loki, you get to actually put your feet up occasionally.

Because different is what they do. These sneakers have tongues that feature a fuzzy grey cat head with pink bow.

Kitty Paws Heels,"True purrrrrrrrfection
			
		
		We happen to be experts in kitten shoes here. Not kitten heels, mind you. Or shoes FOR cats (Kitten Mittens!). Shoes with a cat theme. Our collection is currently down to half a dozen pairs, so we feel pretty confident in stating that generally cat-themed shoes come in two flavors: cat face on the toe or repeating cat pattern fabric on the shoe.Irregular Choice, of course, had to do it different. Because different is what they do. These shoes feature fuzzy ears, a fuzzy tail, and a faux fur covered chunky heel. There's heart cutout fabric across the vamp and counter (the upper bit of the heel), and the strap has the most adorable heart-shaped buckle. It's topped-off (bottomed-off?) with a holographic black glitter platform. They're sparkly and fun and if you get these and you have cats you already know you're going to have to keep them in a box or they will become playthings. Consider yourself warned.Product SpecificationsKitty Paws Heels From the mad geniuses at Irregular ChoiceFuzzy ears, a fuzzy tail, and a faux fur covered chunky heelHeart cutout fabric across the vamp and counter (the upper bit of the heel)Strap has a heart-shaped buckleHolographic black glitter platformMaterials: Fabric and PU upper / PU lining and resin outsoleHeel Height: 4.3""Platform Height: 1/2"" Sizing Table"

		If you've met us here at ThinkGeek World Domination HQ, you know by now that we wouldn't be able to leave our popular Solar Orbit Necklace out there all by its lonesome.

The Star Wars Galactic Necklace highlights some of the more famous planets from galaxies far, far away.

And, of course, the Death Star. This comes in a lovely box, ready to gift, with a key inside the lid like one you'd find in a box of chocolates. Protip: Don't eat Sullust.

Firefly Leaf on the Wind Reversible Necklace,"Likely crash and kill us all
			
		
		On a ship like Serenity, you need a good pilot. That ain't because the ship is a piece of goushi with a crappy compressor coil and issues with the primary buffer planner. No, those are reasons why you need a good mechanic on board. You really need a good pilot because taking just any ol' job that comes along tends to make for more people chasin' after ya. So make sure you get someone to fly the ship who can pull a Crazy Ivan, dohn-ma? Hoban ""Wash"" Washburne might just be the best pilot in the whole 'Verse. No matter who you're a-runnin' from, he'll get the ship and crew through safely... more or less. He is a leaf on the wind. Watch him soar. And keep him with you always, with this sterling silver reversible necklace. One side reads ""I am a leaf on the wind"". The other side reads ""Watch how I soar"".

Mars Orbit Watch,"40 Minutes

Did you hear ""Mars Time"" from AirSpace, the podcast from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, down the street from ThinkGeek World Domination HQ? If you missed it, it was about how trying to keep your body synced to a Mars day, 40 minutes longer than an Earth's Day, wreaks havoc on your naturally circadian body. Apparently beanbag chairs and ice cream makes it better. That's pretty much true for anything, honestly.

This watch celebrates the glory that is the red planet, but it's a standard Earth watch so as not to mess with your head. The Mars Orbit watch has 3-hand movement, with Phobos as the minute hand, Deimos as the hour indicator, and a little rover as the second hand. (At least we think that's how they line up based on which one orbits closer to the planet. The inside one is the minute hand, which should be obvious after a a few minutes.) Does not include life and / or any Earth-shattering kabooms."

Solar Orbit Necklace,"Sparkly star stuff
			
		
		It's humbling to think that every living thing that has ever existed in the universe or ever will is made of the same stuff as we are - very basic atoms formed in the core of hot stars billions of years ago and set on their interstellar journey when those stars exploded. Your fingers, your circulatory system, your brain, they're all so much stellar debris, combining and recombining in an infinite number of ways, creating life before our own existence and far beyond it into the future. Puts everything into perspective, doesn't it? Now whether or not you have that extra piece of cake doesn't seem to make that much of a difference in the grand scheme of things, does it? That's right. We're your enablers. Thank us later. With cake. Celebrate our friendly neighborhood star stuff with this Solar Orbit Necklace. Its 21"" length features not only the Sun and all the planets (including the one that got voted off the island), but also our Moon and the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. And there's a little star shaped charm hanging off the 3"" extender, like a comet. For those who are about to complain that the beads are not to scale, here's the deal: we wanted you to be able to lift your head despite the asteroids in the belt being visible. We think that's a fair trade-off.For our customers with nickel allergies: This item may contain nickel."

Nixon The Unit Boba Fett - Limited Reissue,"He's no good to me dead
			
		
		There is something very memorable about Boba Fett. For a character who had a number of lines in the original trilogy that we can quite literally count on one hand, he left a lasting impression. Maybe it was his demeanor, just standing there, ever silent, gun in hand. It's very intimidating. Or maybe it was his armor, because, let's face the facts, it's pretty awesome looking. Generous wear and tear from all the action Boba has seen. Iconic colors and design. Now, imagine all that, but in the form of a watch.Nixon The Unit Boba Fett watch features a design inspired by one of the galaxy's most feared bounty hunters.

Spiral Galaxy Meteorite Pendant Necklace,"Field of Heaven
			
		
		The Spanish name ""Campo del Cielo"" (""Field of Heaven"") refers to an old legend from the natives of this region of Argentina, that the iron they made their weapons from originally came from a mass that had fallen from the sky. The European conquerors dismissed this silly tale, and searched for the iron vein in the ground or a volcanic source of the metal. But while they were digging around in the dirt, they should have been looking upward, to the stars, for the natives really did know where the Campo del Cielo iron had come from...You'll never forget to look up at the heavens above when you wear this Spiral Galaxy Meteorite Pendant. A solid sterling silver spiral reminiscent of our own Milky Way galaxy, that holds at its center a genuine Campo del Cielo meteorite, dropped from the sky. Presented in an elegant jewelry gift box, this necklace is the gift you can give that comes with a history. A *long* history. For our customers with nickel allergies: This pendant is made from solid nickel-free sterling silver. However, Campo del Cielo meteorites are naturally about 7% nickel.

Coeur Sauvage Necklace Pendant ,"Heart on fire
			
		
		You've probably seen commercials for the new ""Hearts On Fire"" diamond, which is a cutting technique that makes gems even more insanely sparkly than they already are. But to describe them as ""on fire?"" That seems... excessive. Super sparkly and reflective, yes. And we could grant them ""on fire"" if you're going to do science with your diamond to refract the light to a single point. Which we can totally see you doing. But there's a simpler way to set a heart on fire, and it's this: dragons. This necklace portrays a light and dark dragon, tails entwined, a red Swarovski crystal (read: super-sparkly) heart held between them. Hanging from a 21"" split chain, the pendant represents the joining of two into one, the duality of nature, the feeling of elation like flight that you have when you're in love, and, uh, dragons. Because they're awesome.For our customers with nickel allergies: this is made of English pewter, which is a mixture of tin, antimony, and copper. It is free of both lead and nickel."
Dragon Ear Wrap,"Here Be Dragon
  We see people with awesome piercings every so often and think, ""That'd be neat to have, but they must have been working on that for years."" For people who don't have that kind of time, we introduce the commitment-free Dragon Ear Wrap. He hovers over your right shoulder, whispering bad ideas into your ear (like dragons do), but he doesn't require any special piercings; a single, standard earring hole will do. Gotta be in your right earlobe for this to work, though. And, as you can tell from MechaBecca in the photo above, he looks especially great with cartilage piercings, as if he's guarding his hoard. (Note that because of how he curls behind your ear, you might have to modify the backs on your cartilage studs for him to fit, but it's totally worth it to have your ear look like he's curled around a glittering treasure.)   This dragon, made from English pewter, is a little over 3"" tall, a little over 1 1/2"" wide, and around 3/4 deep. It weighs just under 3/4s of an ounce. It is made for the right ear.  Now also available for the left ear; select Left Ear Variant from the dropdown!    For our customers with nickel allergies: the dragon is made of English pewter, which is a mixture of tin, antimony, and copper. It is free of both lead and nickel. The post is surgical-steel, which is a mixture of chromium, nickel and molybdenum. The post meets the guidelines set forth in EU Nickel Directive 94/27/EC."

Celestial Fireworks LED Bracelet,"Star spangled bangle
			
		
		Jewelry is often a precious heirloom handed down from generation to generation. So when you compliment someone on a necklace, and they say it was their great-grandmother's 100 years ago, that's no surprise. But when people compliment you on your bracelet, you can say it's 20,000 years old. And it really was handed down to you by your ancestors, considering we are all at our core nothing less than star stuff. This Celestial Fireworks Bracelet celebrates a spectacular image captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope of Westerlund 2, a cluster in the constellation Carina. (It's 20,000 light years away, so this image really is that old.) On its own, it's a gorgeous image, but we've highlighted the young star cluster's sparkle by adding 15 tiny twinkling white LED lights to represent more foreground stars. They're powered by a rechargeable battery; the hinged bangle ships with a proprietary USB charging cable to keep it entwinkling. But there's an on/off button, too, in case you prefer it dark. Either way, it's a fabulous tribute to the magnificence that is space and mankind's exploration of it.For our customers with nickel allergies: the inside of the band is made from stainless steel."

Star Wars Yoda Stacked Pendants Necklace,"See Through Him, You Can
			
		
		Yoda's size was never an issue - he was in complete oneness with the Force. An X-Wing stuck in the muddy swamp didn't even make the 2-feet, 2-inch tall Jedi Master break a sweat. However, for a pendant that you want to wear every day, size does matter. Even Timmy knows this. That's why we offer you the Star Wars Yoda Stacked Pendants Necklace. The 3/4"" discs go perfect with your Rebel uniform, and the cutout of Yoda's silhouette lets you see his most famous proverb: ""Do, or do not. There is no try.""

GotG Sterling Groot Basket Branch Ladies' Ring,"Get Your Groot On
			
		
		Jewelry should remind you of the people you love. The traditional wedding ring is there to remind you of a spouse, the Irish claddagh brings up loyalty to blood relations, but what about that family that we make for ourselves, on a spaceship, guarding the galaxy from baddies that want to mess with it? There should be a ring for that. Oh, but there is! A subtle homage to the grootiest of tree folks, at first glance it looks like an artisan piece you might have picked up at an earthy festival. But when you spot the tiny engraving, ""I am Groot,"" you realize that this piece is, in fact, out of this world. A tribute to the selfless Groot and the space family that you create for yourself.

Solar Eclipse Charmed Simplicity Necklace,"Timelessly sublime
			
		
		There are all sorts of trends in jewelry. There were the jelly bracelets, the big chains, and the puffy heart pendant back in the 80s. The chokers and toe rings of the 90s. The silicone bracelets and druzy of the 2000s. But natural phenomena have one advantage over all of these - they're pretty much guaranteed to be timelessly sublime.Pick up a Solar Eclipse Charmed Simplicity Necklace today as a remembrance of the 2017 eclipse. It's guaranteed not to go out of style, because, well, space doesn't go out of style. Nobody says, ""Kepler-186f is SO last week."" Enjoy your own personal solar eclipse for many years to come. For our customers with nickel allergies: Both the pendant and chain are nickel-free."
D&D Logo Pendant,"An Ampersand to Die for
			
		
		We didn't understand why in the mid 90s they decided to go away from the clever dragon ampersand we were gifted with way back in AD&D. Sure, the new logos were ""designed to modernize the look of the game."" We understand, marketing peeps. But it's a game about knights and quests and dragons. Your target audience really isn't much into ""modern.""This pendant features the latest iteration of the glorious ampersand, rendered by Glitschka Studios and dimensionalized by WotC. It's a statement piece at 1 1/2"" square that really shows off your old-school RPG fandom. We also have this as a pin, but personally we're actually going to take this one and use it as a favor on our renfest costume, because it has a bit of extra dimensionality the pin lacks. * We totally stole that amazing headline from Brand New, a site that reviews corporate and brand identity work. For our customers with nickel allergies: This is made from 316 grade surgical stainless steel.

She-Ra Helmet Ring,"He-Man who?
			
		
		Step aside, He-Man! The only Master of the Universe we need is the Princess of Power. First, She-ra's real name is Adora. Adoring her is practically required! And second, she's He-Man's long-lost twin (DRAMA!). And while He-Man may have a nifty armored cat as a steed, She-Ra rides an actual unicorn. A unicorn with RAINBOW WINGS. It's almost unfair how awesome she is! And She-Ra totally knows it. We figure that's why she's got wings on her helmet, too. He-Man's helmet is pretty cool too, of course... oh wait, he doesn't even HAVE a helmet (but he does have a bold harness, which we also approve of wholeheartedly). We just love everything about She-Ra, which is why we're thrilled with this gorgeous Han Cholo ring. It recreates her iconic winged helmet right down to to the red stone in the front and the antiqued gold color. We can't all have flying unicorns, but we can wear our own little piece of the Princess of Power.For our customers with nickel allergies: This is made from 316 grade surgical stainless steel. This item may have small amounts of nickel, but they're low enough to meet the guidelines set forth in EU Nickel Directive 94/27/EC."
Raven Ear-wing Ear Wrap,"Dark wings, dark words
			
		
		Wouldn't it be fun to have your own raven, trained like the ones from Game of Thrones? You could send it to Starbucks to fetch you a coffee. (And they'd send an orange one out at the start of Pumpkin Latte season.) You could send it out with your party acceptances or declines instead of clicking the dropdown on Facebook. Oh wait. Even better. You know who we'd send ours to? We'd send it to folks who ignore our email. Good luck ignoring this one. This Raven Ear-wing Ear Wrap, made from blackened English pewter, is a little over 2"" tall, a little over 1 1/2"" wide, and just over 1/2"" deep. It weighs just over 1/4 of an ounce. It is made for the left ear.For our customers with nickel allergies: the raven is made of English pewter, which is a mixture of tin, antimony, and copper. It is free of both lead and nickel. The post is surgical-steel, which is a mixture of chromium, nickel and molybdenum. The post meets the guidelines set forth in EU Nickel Directive 94/27/EC."

		We remember from our preteen years that pins are a quick and relatively inexpensive way to proclaim your fandom to everyone around. We sported Pac-Man, Duran Duran, and Doctor Who (obtained in England) on our LeSportsac bag (ed. note: which we totally didn't have. we had a knockoff). Because you couldn't wear your fandom t-shirt every day.

GotG Sterling Dancing Groot Earrings,"He's got sweet moves
			
		
		You know, Groot can really move. Well, provided Drax ain't lookin'. Movement isn't really a thing trees are known for. You wouldn't think a Flora Colossus would be so light on his... roots? But Groot's always surprising us. These Groots earrings really move, too, thanks to a jump ring where the carved vine bodies are attached to his little head, so he can jovially wiggle as you move.

		You've always had your own thing going on. Been a little different from everyone else. Had issues with authority.

All three hang from a 24"" antiqued brass rolo chain. And much like Browncoats themselves, each is individually distressed. That means no two are exactly alike.

Fantastic Beasts Wand Necklace,"Which one will choose you?
			
		
		These necklaces are pretty sizeable. They made us wonder how tall a figure would have to be in order for this to be the correct wand length for them. Given an average wand length of 11 1/2"" inches and average British / American height at 5 foot 9 inches, these wands would be perfect for someone just over 2 feet tall. So basically, this is an ideal wand for your 4-5 month old infant, but please don't give it to them. 1) Long pointy metal bits are unpleasant when swallowed and 2) You don't want to know what that ""Ga Ga Goo Goo"" spell does.So long as you have your federal wand permit you can show us at checkout, you can pick up one of these lovely Fantastic Beasts Wand Necklace.

And while we may no longer rely on the shadows cast by celestial bodies, the ancients who came before the development of water clocks and hourglasses must have been particularly vexed when an eclipse occurred. Although, ""I am late because something ate the Sun"" is probably a pretty good excuse no matter where you are in terms of technological development. With this watch you can go back to telling the time using the Sun and the Moon. A ThinkGeek exclusive, the face of this watch features a black and white animation which shows an eclipse corona and cycles brighter twice an hour. With a stainless steel case with genuine leather watchband, this'll be with you for many eclipses to come.Product SpecificationsCommemorative Solar Eclipse WatchA ThinkGeek exclusiveBlack and white animation shows the corona and cycles brighter twice an hourGlow-in-the-dark indicators on the handsFunctions: 3-hand movementMovement: Japanese movement Materials: Stainless steel case with genuine leather watchbandWater Resistance: 30 meter / 3 ATMBatteries: 1 SR626SW (included)Dimensions: 1.45"" case with 0.63"" wide bandHoles punched to fit wrists 6 1/2"" - 8 3/4"" aroundWeight: 1 1/2 oz."

Dragonhenge Bracelet,"Dragon Rehabilitation
			
		
		You are so good to take this little dragon in. See, he isn't going to get very far with just one wing. He was spotted flying in circles over Kentucky before we relocated him to this little box in our warehouse for his own protection. Hopefully, he'll gain strength each time you wear him. And even if he can never be released, you can use him to educate kids about how dragons are a vital part of our ecosystem. This Dragonhenge Bracelet is a dragon hinge bracelet. (We entertain ourselves by making up words.*) He has an understated matte finish, and the hinged design means he fits a wide variety of (human) wrists. Just be careful if you wear bling around this little guy. You know about dragons and their gem hoarding. They're so sparkly; he just can't help himself.* For the purists, we're classifying this little guy as part of Class I Henges: ""a roughly circular or oval-shaped bank with an internal ditch"" (the gap between the bracelet and your wrist) ""which have a single entrance created from a gap in the bank.""

You have been competing in the Crucible, completing Public Events and Nightfall Strikes, survived the Prison of Elders, and turned in bounties - all in search of these unusual little coins. But are the exotic wares of the mysterious Agent of the Nine what you seek, or do you collect these strange objects for their own sake?

Harry Potter Lumos Gryffindor Charm Bracelet,"Daring, nerve, and jewelry
 A charm bracelet seems a very innocent trinket. What other piece of jewellery is so imbued with memory and sentiment? Why do we call those little masterpieces ""charms"" if not in allusion to their talismanic properties? They have meaning beyond the mercenary. They are personal amulets. - J.K. Rowling   When we heard we were getting a bunch of Harry Potter charms, we thought that was awesome, but we wondered how we were going to store said charms at the warehouse. Have a wizard sitting on one of the shelves, ready to incant when someone orders one? Magical logistics are complicated.Then we realized we were talking about a different kind of charm. This Lumos Gryffindor Charm Bracelet lets you show off your HP fandom with three exclusive jewelry charms: the Gryffindor House Crest (double-sided), the Sorting Hat, and a Lumos butterfly.

Sterling Silver Bracelet for Charms,"Your Bracelet, Just How You Like It
To see all our charm beads, click here. We had these sterling silver bracelets custom made for us with a toggle closure because we think toggles are so much easier to close with one hand than lobster clasps or twisty things or whatnot. The toggle bar itself attaches with a lobster clasp to allow you to put beads on and take them off. The chain is 3mm in diameter, which means it fits basically all major brands of bead, whether they have threads or not: PANDORA, Chamilia, and Biagi (sorry, Troll folks). So if you have beads but want the toggle bracelet, chances are your beads will fit on this bracelet. We have compatibility issues every day with our computers. We don't need them with our jewelry. Product Specifications  Each bracelet is made of solid sterling silver. Toggle closure for easy on-off. Note: The weave of the silver will eventually cause it to stretch. If that happens to a bracelet that used to fit perfectly, pop another bead on. Contains small parts. Not for children under 3."
Star Trek TNG Mirror Universe Magnetic Badge,"These are the voyages of the I.S.S. Enterprise...

Star Trek fans sure are getting a lot of mirror universe action recently. And even if Discovery's portrayal of the Terran Empire isn't your thing, it's hard not to be a fan of IDW's Mirror Broken comic series, boldly going where TNG has not gone before. 

Straight from the version of the Terran Empire created by writers Scott and David Tipton and artist JK Woodward, this Star Trek TNG Mirror Universe Magnetic Badge has everything. It's metal. It's got magnets on the back, so you don't have to stick holes in your uniform. The only thing it doesn't have is actual combadge functions. Which is good. Look, you don't want to call the Terran Empire; this is non-functioning for your own protection."

		What, you think Batman doesn't have a watch to keep track of time? Granted, a Batwatch might have a laser cutter or something cool attached to it, but Batman for sure has places to be. He needs a watch to know when to be at the bank that Two-Face is planning on robbing. Might be a little embarrassing if he showed up late to that party. And possibly even worse if Bruce Wayne kept some Gotham millionaire waiting.Have your very own bat-gadget with the Batman Logo Watch. This watch features the iconic Batman logo in the center of the clock face. It may not shoot out a grappling dart to hoist you up a building, but it will tell you the time just fine. And let everyone who sees it wonder about the tiny grappling hook possibility."

His Monster / Her Monster ID Bracelet,"You're my favorite monster
			
		
		It's important to remember that Mary Shelley never gave her monster a name. It is we who named him Frankenstein after his creator. Frankenstein may be about many things, but one of the topics the story broaches is loneliness - that feeling the monster has that he is the only one of his kind in the world. He needs his own monster to feel kinship in this world. We know that feeling of not fitting in, and maybe you do, too. Perhaps you also have a special monster in your life, or you are that special monster for someone else. This set of bracelets, reading ""His Monster"" and ""Her Monster,"" lets you declare both your relationship and your otherworldliness all in one. Note: This is how we got them from the manufacturer. If this is perfect for you but your relationship is a different combination of pronouns, perhaps you could hook up with someone in the comments who is also looking.

After all, what better way to make people fear you than with a bold display of your loyalty to the Galactic Empire? As they say, the Empire's rule is more about fear of the Force than the Force itself. Is there a chance that people won’t even know what this symbol is? Maybe.

Nightmare Before Christmas Jack Watch,"Only 364 days left till next Halloween
			
		
		Jack is on a strict timeline. He only has 364 days to plan the next big day, and that's not easy. He needs to keep track of time or else it's just going to be the same routine and he'll try and borrow another holiday again.

He's giving a bit of an inquisitive look, almost like he just crushed an ornament again and is fascinated by how it reacted with his science concoction."
Black Panther Logo Watch,"Long live the movie
Black Panther has a long runtime. It clocks in at 135 minutes, which is apparently longer than any other Marvel movie that has a single superhero in it. But think about it: Black Panther doesn't have the same name-recognition that Cap has. Black Panther is fewer than ten minutes longer than Iron Man, and Tony Stark lives in a world we all know or quickly recognize. Sure, GotG was new for a lot of people, but it was sort of, ""Here's the 80s - now everything else is not as you know it."" Pretty cut and dry. Wakanda exists as part of our world, so it's more important to make minute distinctions so audiences are acquainted with what's the same and what's different.  If you so desire, you can track the movie runtime and also pay tribute to a king and superhero with your Black Panther Logo Watch. With a sleek matte black case with a faux leather band, this watch features Black Panther's mask in glossy black on the face. And check your watch before you shout ""Long live the king!"" so people know you're tracking exactly how long. Actually, that sounds kind of morbid, doesn't it? Scratch that. Just use it to time how long it takes to run out and get another small popcorn."
Deadpool Logo Watch,"Time to make the chimi-**cking-changas!
			
		
		Here's a weird thought: when Deadpool has to saw his hand off to get out of a situation by relying on his healing factor, do you think he cuts above or below the watch? Because the hand regenerates but the watch, not so much. Guess it depends on how much he likes the watch and whether or not he needs to be somewhere on time.This Deadpool Logo Watch is pretty special. We're particularly fond of the massive face. This is not a subtle watch. If you like it, too, add it to your cart now, because we promise that putting ""watch Deadpool"" in a search engine will not bring you back here."

Ikarus Ear Wrap,"Don't fly too high!
			
		
		Did you have your parents' approval the first time you got your ears pierced? Or the second? How about the first time you got a tattoo or had a drink? Many of the wisest people out there ignore sound advice simply because it is coming from the mouths of authority figures. Icarus did the same. He and his father were set to escape from Crete with wings made of wax and feathers and his father warned him not to fly too low or too high. He ignored his father's advice and fueled by hubris (we get to use that word here because it's a Greek mythological tragedy) ventured to close to the sun. His wax wings melted and he plunged to his death in the sea. Show your rebellious side with this Steampunk-inspired Ikarus Ear Wrap.

Pizza Charm Necklace,"A Little Slice of Heaven
			
		
		We love pizza so much, we're ready to throw down and say that it might just be the perfect food. All four food groups are represented: from the soft-yet-crispy carb crust, to the fruit/vegetable tomato sauce, to the calcium-rich dairy cheese, to our choice of protein-filled toppings (pepperoni is a classic favorite, of course). All in one dish that doesn't require any utensils or even a plate, if you're well-trained in the arts of slice balancing. And it can even feed a crowd... if we were willing to share, that is.We could wear our love for pizza on our sleeves, but that could get very messy.

Necronomicon Necklace,"That Is Not Dead Which Can Eternal Lie
			
		
		The Necronomicon, the grimoire of the Cthulhu mythos is said to have originally been written by Abdul Alhazred, the ""Mad Arab"", in approximately 738 AD and to contain accounts of the Old Ones, their history and the means by which to summon them. The very act of studying the text is inherently dangerous, as those who attempt to master its arcane knowledge generally meet terrible ends. Will you take such a chance in unlocking the secrets of the Old Ones?Inspired by the gothic horror stories of HP Lovecraft, this locket-like Necronomicon necklace has been skillfully crafted in nickle-plated bronze and carefully hand finished. The book pendant is hinged so that it can open and close, if you dare. On the outside, you'll find hand carved designs containing ancient symbols to bind, contain, and capture the dark secrets held within the book. The patterns along the sides of the book are abstract depictions of Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth. The corner caps of the book are engraved with the Elder Sign to hold the Old Ones and their servants at bay. Open the book to find the infamous rhyming couplet engraved in Arabic:   That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.  For our customers with nickel allergies: The pendant is made from nickle-plated bronze. The chain is made from stainless steel. That means it could contain nickel. This is implant-grade steel."
GotG Groot Charm Bracelet,"Say the magic words!
			
		
		Groot (Flora colossus) is a very tall, very tree-like creature. He has very rigid vocal cords (they are made out of wood, ya know) which makes all his speech sound like, ""I am Groot."" Frankly, we think this is a bunch of bunk. We think Groot can say all sorts of things, he just chooses not to. Why? It's just one of those weird, movie star quirks.  Well, with this bracelet, at least you'll hear him coming, even if he doesn't say a word. Or just three words. One of those stylish, adjustable wire bangles, this bracelet has a charm with the the declaration ""I am Groot,"" baby Groot's head, a gold spore with crystal in the middle, and a Marvel logo hanging from it.

Daughters of Darkness Ear Wrap,"Immortal. Untouchable. Beautiful.
			
		
		The Pleiades were the seven daughters of Atlas (a Titan who led a war against Zeus) and the nymph Pleione. After Atlas lost his war, he was condemned to carry the heavens on his shoulders for all of eternity. (With no eternal chiropractor to help him, we're pretty sure.) Some stories say the Pleiades were heartbroken at the fate of their father and committed suicide - after which Zeus immortalized them in the stars, to comfort their father. Because looking up and being reminded your of your dead daughters while carrying a planet seems comforting? Greek gods were weird.Another story claims that Orion began pursuing the sisters in earnest after their father was condemned. Zeus devised a way to keep the Pleiades from Orion's clutches forever: he set them in the stars where Orion may always pursue them, but could never reach them. (That seems a bit more reassuring to a father with an eternally aching back.)Whichever version of the story you prefer, now you can wear the seven sisters in all their glory with the Daughters of Darkness Ear Wrap. Made with English pewter, the wrap depicts the Pleiades with seven Swarovski crystals, with the final one, Atlas, suspended on the dangle. The constellation can be gently bent to fit your right ear comfortably, while the post is fastened with a surgical steel post. (Yes, it's safe for those of us with nickel allergies!) For our customers with nickel allergies: These are made of English pewter, which is a mixture of tin, antimony, and copper. It is free of both lead and nickel. The post is surgical-steel, which is a mixture of chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. The back is plastic.

Rick and Morty Portal Watch,"And away we go!

Morty: Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?

Yeah. We don't know either. However, you should know that Rick and Morty appear to have opened a portal on your wrist.

		It's a Friday night and it's been a long week. Princess threatened, Alderaan destroyed, all those Stormtroopers. Sigh. It's times like these Vader is glad the door to his quarters has a lock.

And what's the point of jewelry if nobody's checking out your bling, being jealous? At least it should be able to make you feel better in your quarters at the end of a long day.That's why Vader has his favorite personal weapon, a weapon for a more civilized age, immortalized as both a bracelet and a ring.

All four food groups are represented: from the soft-yet-crispy carb crust, to the fruit/vegetable tomato sauce, to the calcium-rich dairy cheese, to our choice of protein-filled toppings (pepperoni is a classic favorite, of course). All in one dish that doesn't require any utensils or even a plate, if you're well-trained in the arts of slice balancing. And it can even feed a crowd... if we were willing to share, that is.We could wear our love for pizza on our sleeves, but that could get very messy.

Black Panther Claw Pendant Necklace,"""I am the king of a small African nation.""
			
		
		T'Challa is one of the most versatile Marvel heroes. As Black Panther he has served on several teams, including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. He's one of their smartest minds, on par with Reed Richards and Tony Stark. He was married to Storm from the X-Men for a time. He's been the King of Wakanda and also the King of the Dead. He's fought nearly every foe under the sun to save his people, his world, and all of reality - and he does it all in a mysterious head-to-toe black costume with a claw collar.  We can't seem to pull off footy pajamas-as-daywear (not that we haven't tried! #lifegoals), but we can take a page out of the Black Panther lookbook with this stainless steel claw pendant necklace. This goth-edgy piece is inspired by his costume, but subtle enough to wear every day. The claw pendants have a contrasting black PVD coating - because obviously we aren't going to risk any heroic wrath by using actual animal claws! Each one hangs from the end of the long 30"" chain, which crosses in the front for a long lariat style look. It probably won't give you any added athletic prowess (only the Panther God can do that), but you can still look fierce!

Enjoy this period of rebirth, the start of a new cycle, with a New Moon Charmed Simplicity Necklace.

Solar Eclipse Moonstock Bangle Bracelet,"Timelessly sublime
			
		
		There are all sorts of trends in jewelry. There were the jelly bracelets, the big chains, and the puffy heart pendant back in the 80s. The chokers and toe rings of the 90s.

8-Bit Watch,"20 Minutes into the Past
			
		
		In the heyday of Atari, the coveted watches were either Swatches with their awesome silicone bands or digital watches with calculators built in. For those, basically the bigger they were the better they were. So although this watch never would have been popular back in the day, it lets us remember back to a simpler time. Say... 5:30. This 8-Bit Watch is analog with an understated face and a pixelated jaggy silicone band. With black stainless steel findings and a black band, it's extra sleek, almost sucking in the light around it. Okay. It's just a watch. It's not going to cause a hole in the time-space continuum. But it's a neat looking watch, and one you won't find anywhere else."

		There's fame and then there's geek fame. Fame gets you stopped in the grocery store. It gets people to ask for your signature when you're trying to eat dinner.

Masters of the Universe Tri-Klops Ring,"Eyes in the back of your hand
			
		
		If you could have only one of Tri-Klops's powers (which, for today's exercise are Gammavision, the ability to see through solid objects; Night-vision, the ability to see in the dark; and Dista-vision, the ability to see long distances), which one would you choose? Dista-vision seems like a weird thing to have if you presumably can't see in 3D since you have one eye doing all the work. You wouldn't know if something was right next to you and small or really far away and huge. Heck, with two eyes, we still have trouble with that sometimes. Moving on. With this Masters of the Universe Tri-Klops Ring, you don't have to choose. Fashioned after Tri-Klops's rotating visor helmet, it features all three eyes. Spin the band to have a specific eye facing up. This is particularly useful if you're following a canon where they shoot energy bolts. Pew pew pew all the annoying things.

9 Lives Stealer Sword Cuff,"Saving Throw not required
			
		
		Since 5e launched, Han Cholo has been coming across a bunch of these drained Nine Lives Stealer Swords (now basically +2 longswords) discarded in various alleyways around LA, and they thought, ""What can we do with these?"" (How they figured out they were empty of charges, we didn't ask. We don't want to know. Also, LA must be a high-level campaign setting.) So they took them back to the studio and turned them into cuffs, complete with ominous skulls on the pommel, guard, and chappe. You don't have to worry about accidentally ripping away anybody's life force with these 9 Lives Stealer Sword Cuffs, since they're drained and also not sharp.

That's so much more beautiful than - what was it the Rebels were after, again? Chaos? Disorder? Petty squabbling? Pay tribute to the last great accomplishment of the glorious Empire with this Death Star Stacked Pendants necklace.

Steamhammer Pendant,"The hammer for blowing off some steam
			
		
		Thor's Hammer actually was forged from steam. Well, okay, not so much steam as metal and Dwarf-power. But it's because of hot air (yeah, fine, no water = no steam) that the handle's so short. Or, rather, it's because Loki's kind of an asshole (it's his thing) and he turned into a fly so he could bite the dwarf manning the bellows providing oxygen to the fire in the forge which made blood run into said Dwarf's eye, and when he reached up to wipe it away, the handle got messed up because the fire cooled down. The moral of the story being if you interact with Loki, you should probably hang flypaper. But we digress. This huge Steamhammer Pendant is a statement piece. It's a great size for guys, but it also works for women who like chunky jewelry. Good for fans of Norse mythology, Thor, and steampunk - really, anybody who falls into any part of that Venn diagram, but especially folks smack dab in the middle.

Pok&#xe9;mon Pikachu Gold Back Silhouette Pendant Necklace,"Stand Behind Your Pokémon
			
		
		Pikachu is a true friend. When the going gets rough, he's not going to bail on you. And that's because you wouldn't bail on Pikachu, either. Stand behind your Pokémon, and you will always have a friend when you're in need. And as a bonus, you'll get to look at some cute Pokémon backsides. What? We like Poké butts and we cannot lie!Pikachu shows off the backside that his Momma Pika gave him on this gold silhouette pendant. Actually, it's silver with a gold PVD coating. What's PVD, you ask? It stands for Physical Vapor Deposition, which is a cool solid/liquid-to-gas-to-solid-again coating technique that is more durable against corrosion than gold plating. Pikachu used PVD - it's super effective against everyday wear-and-tear! And a super cute behind. For our customers with nickel allergies: Yellow gold typically does not contain nickel."

		If we met adult Groot, we imagine it'd be super hard to avoid pulling a Rocket and scrambling up him for a better view. Especially when we were kids it would have been. Any tree with a foothold low enough was fair game for our mad climbing skillz. And Groot would be no exception.  This Groot is climbing. If he were on a tree, he could be a tree climbing tree. Of course, he's not really a tree, but imagine it for a second, just because it makes us giggle. And you are not a tree; it's your ear he's climbing.

Harry Potter Lumos Hufflepuff Charm Bracelet,"Dedication, patience, and jewelry
 A charm bracelet seems a very innocent trinket. What other piece of jewellery is so imbued with memory and sentiment? Why do we call those little masterpieces ""charms"" if not in allusion to their talismanic properties? They have meaning beyond the mercenary. They are personal amulets. - J.K. Rowling   When we heard we were getting a bunch of Harry Potter charms, we thought that was awesome, but we wondered how we were going to store said charms at the warehouse. Have a wizard sitting on one of the shelves, ready to incant when someone orders one? Magical logistics are complicated.Then we realized we were talking about a different kind of charm. This Lumos Hufflepuff Charm Bracelet lets you show off your HP fandom with three exclusive jewelry charms: the Hufflepuff House Crest (double-sided), the Sorting Hat, and a Lumos butterfly.

Marvel Infinity Gauntlet Stud Earrings,"Most Powerful Earrings in the Universe
			
		
		Now, you might have some objections to these Infinity Gauntlet earrings. First of all, there are two of them, but that's not actually much of a problem - we've already seen that there are, in fact, two Infinity Gauntlets out there (the right-handed one in Odin's Treasure room, and the left-handed one in Thanos's grubby mitts). But both of these Infinity Gauntlets are loaded up with Infinity Stones, and that's a problem, since there is definitely only one of each stone out there. Right? Whoa, we hope we're right about that...Thankfully, each of these Infinity Gauntlet Stud Earrings is loaded up with replicas of the real Infinity Stones, so you don't have to worry about say, accidentally blinking half the universe out of existence with a mere thought when you wear them. Because that would be awkward. But they are shiny and nice to look at, and they're such convincing little replicas that you might even throw Thanos off for a second, which could give the time to swipe the real thing from him. Once you obtain the ultimate power in the universe, please just remember the friends at ThinkGeek who sold you those earrings in the first place, okay? We don't so much want to be blinked out of existence.For our customers with nickel allergies: This is made from 316L grade surgical stainless steel.

The strap of the belt is decorated with the planetary version of the atomic model, and the buckle is an oversized atomic model. The wallet has a small metal atomic model on front to remind you that your wallet, your pants - well, everything physical - is made up of atoms."
